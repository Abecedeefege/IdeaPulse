# If you accidentally deleted files

## Your IdeaPulse project is here

The full app is in this folder. All key files are present (package.json, src/app, src/lib, etc.).

## If files look missing in Cursor

1. **Open the right folder**  
   File → Open Folder → choose **IdeaGenerator** (the folder that contains `package.json` and `src`).  
   Path on your machine: `Playground/IdeaGenerator` or `Documents/GitHub/Playground/IdeaGenerator`.

2. **Restore from Git (if you use Source Control)**  
   - Open **Source Control** (branch icon in the left sidebar).  
   - If you see deleted files listed, click **Discard All Changes** or right‑click each and choose **Restore** to bring them back from the last commit.

## If you deleted files on GitHub (repo looks empty)

Your local folder still has everything. Push again:

1. Open **Source Control** in Cursor.
2. Click **Push** (or **Publish Branch** if needed).
3. Sign in to GitHub if asked.

That will repopulate the GitHub repo and trigger a new Vercel deploy.
